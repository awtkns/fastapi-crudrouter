## [v0.7.0 - Advanced Dependencies ](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter/releases/tag/v0.7.0) { .releases } 
2021-04-18
### üéâ Highlights
With the release of v0.7.0 fastapi-crudrouter now provides the ability to set custom dependencies on a per route basis; a much requested feature. Prior to this release, it was only possible to set dependencies for all the routes at once. 

```python
MemoryCRUDRouter(
    schema=MySchema,
    create_route=[Depends(user)],
    delete_all_route=[Depends(admin)]
)
```

Shown above is a brief example on how limiting each route to specific access rights would work using this new feature. Check out the [docs](https://fastapi-crudrouter.awtkns.com/dependencies/) for more details.

```python
CRUDRouter(
    schema=MyPydanticModel,

from fastapi_crudrouter import MemoryCRUDRouter as CRUDRouter

class Potato(BaseModel):
